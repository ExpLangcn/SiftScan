### Parameter

```bash
[SiftScan] Committed to improving the efficiency of red and blue confrontation/loophole bounty. By: ExplangÔΩúTwitter: @ExpLang_Cn

Usage:
  SiftScan [flags]

Flags:
      --ai string       Intelligent scanning, enter the target Url, the target can be IP | domain name | subdomain | URL, the program will automatically identify the target type, build the scanning process and scan it.
      --debug           Debug mode
  -h, --help            help for SiftScan
  -m, --mode string     Crawling mode, simple/smart/strict, default smart (default "smart")
      --proxy string    The requested agent, for the access URL outside the wall, the direct connection is empty by default.
  -t, --target string   A single URL to execute crawling
```

### Refer to

#### Scan the target file

Automatically filter target typesÔºåUse the `--ai` parameter to specify the target file.

```bash
ExpLang ‚ö° cat target.txt
	http://www.xxx.com
	120.xxx.xxx.231
	xxxÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêË¥£‰ªªÂÖ¨Âè∏
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan --ai target.txt
```

#### Scan the specified target

Automatically filter the target type and use the `-t` parameter to specify the target information.

```bash
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "xxxÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêË¥£‰ªªÂÖ¨Âè∏"
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "120.xxx.xxx.231"
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "http://www.xxx.com"
```

#### Appoint Crawling mode

```bash
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "xxxÁßëÊäÄÊúâÈôêË¥£‰ªªÂÖ¨Âè∏" -m simple
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "120.xxx.xxx.231" -m smart
ExpLang ‚ö° ./SiftScan -t "http://www.xxx.com" -m strict
```
